        "a": "Incorrect. Expression evaluates to n<sup>2</sup>. Vector is of length n.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Expression evaluates to 2<sup>n</sup>. Vector is of length n.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Totally order events by themselves",
        "b": "Can only establish Partial Ordering",
        "c": "Can be used along with arbitrary tiebreaks to establish partial ordering",
        "d": "Can be used to establish causal ordering"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It is possible for two events to have no causal connection to the other. Ordering is indeterminate in this case",
        "b": "Incorrect. It is possible for concurrent events to be ordered by another metric to establish total order",
        "c": "Incorrect. Concurrent events may be arbitrarily ordered for a total ordering",
